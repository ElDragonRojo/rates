# Open Rates

A lot of people think it's somehow wrong to talk about money. I think those ideas were added to our culture by people who benefit from us not sharing that information with each other.

Over the years I've tried to balance demands for my time within a realistic ethical framework. What I mean by that is, I am not interested in most things people want me to spend my time on, but I don't want to adopt a high and mighty position about it.

I used to think that I would never sell out because, to me, a million dollars and a hundred million dollars are the same amount of money: more than I need. My mentor disabused me of that by saying, "a hundred million dollars would save a lot of lemurs."

So I accept that everyone has their price, and I have set mine at the arbitrariy round figure of €1000 per hour. Perhaps that is absurdly high, but if you want access to my particular set of experiences, and don't want to have to negotiate, there it is.

## Speaking

I am drastically curtailing my regular speaking appearances to a few favorite conferences, but you can still hire me to present on the topic and in the costume of your choice for €4000 plus travel, hotel, and reasonable expenses for two people.

## Discounts

I still do very limited consulting in very limited circumstances for Appsterdammers and other friends for €100.
