# Open Rates

We are trained not to talk about money by the people who benefit from our silence, so let's talk about it.

Most of my engineering time is booked by [good companies](https://github.com/ElDragonRojo/good) run by people I've known for years and trust well enough to pay me whatever.

I can still be hired at rates ranging from reasonable to ridiculous, based on availability and the general good.

## Discounts

If I like your team and what you're doing, we might be able to work something out with certain conditions. I love working with good people. The business decision is balancing budget, demand, and availability.

## Inquiries

Contact my partner judy.i.chen at gmail. All rates exclusive VAT and subject to availability.

On-site consultations outside the Netherlands require travel, hotel, and reasonable expenses for two people.
